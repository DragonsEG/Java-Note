```

the `.idea/` directory contains the project's configuration files for IntelliJ IDEA, which is an IDE for Java projects.
the `lib/` directory contains the project's dependencies, which are external libraries that the project depends on.
The `src/` directory contains the source code of the project. It is typically divided into two subdirectories: `main/`
and `test/`.

* The `main/` directory contains the main code of the project, which is divided into `java/` and `resources/`.
* The `java/` directory contains the Java source code organized into packages.
* The `resources/` directory contains any non-Java resources that are required by the application, such as configuration
  files, property files, and images.

* The `test/` directory contains the unit tests for the project, organized into `java/` and `resources/`.

The `target/` directory contains the compiled code, as well as any generated artifacts, such as JAR files.

The `pom.xml` file is the project's configuration file for Maven, which is a popular build tool for Java projects.

The `README.md` file is a text file that provides information about the project, such as how to build and run it.

The `.gitignore` file is a file that tells Git which files and directories to ignore when committing changes to the
project's repository.

# Java Programming Steps

## 1. Write the code "ClassName.java"

### Example:

```java
public class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Don't Worry about the syntax for now. We will learn it in the next few weeks.

## 2. Compile the code "javac ClassName.java"

* Compiling a Java program means taking the programmer-readable text in your program file (source code) and converting
  it to bytecodes.
* Bytecodes are the instructions that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) understands.

### Example:

The Java compiler is invoked at the command line by typing the command:

```bash
javac ClassName.java
```

## 3. Run the code "java ClassName"

Running a Java program means executing the bytecodes that were created by the compiler.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the program that executes the bytecodes.

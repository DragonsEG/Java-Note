# JDK (Java Development Kit)

    is a software development kit used for developing Java applications.

Its life cycle consists of several stages, including:

## Planning and Design:

* During this stage, the requirements for the software development project are identified, and a plan for the
  development of the software is created.
* The design of the application, including the user interface, functionality, and architecture, is also created during
  this stage.

## Development:

* The development stage involves writing the code for the application.
* The JDK provides a set of tools for developers, including the Java compiler, which converts the source code into
  bytecode that can be executed on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* The development stage may also involve testing the code to ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications.

## Testing:

* The testing stage involves evaluating the software to ensure that it works as intended and meets the requirements of
  the project.
* Different types of testing may be performed during this stage, including unit testing, integration testing, and
  acceptance testing.

## Deployment:

* During the deployment stage, the software is released to the production environment.
* This may involve installing the software on servers or making it available for download from a website.

## Maintenance:

* After the software is deployed, the maintenance stage begins.
* This involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software, including fixing bugs and adding new features as
  needed.

The JDK life cycle may involve several iterations of these stages as new requirements are identified, and changes are
made to the software. Throughout the life cycle, it is important to follow best practices and industry standards to
ensure that the software is of high quality and meets the needs of its users.

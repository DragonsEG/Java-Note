# JDK, JVM, and JRE

    - JDK, JVM, and JRE are all important components of the Java platform.
    - Each plays a specific role in the execution of Java programs.

what they are and how they work:

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

* The JDK is a software development kit used by Java developers to create Java applications.
* It includes all the necessary tools to compile, debug, and run Java code, as well as various libraries and
  documentation.
* Some tools included in the JDK are the Java compiler (javac), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and the Java
  Archive (JAR) tool.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

**the same Java code can be run on any device that has a JVM installed.**

* The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
* It is the runtime environment in which Java code is executed.
* The JVM interprets compiled Java code, optimizing it at runtime for better performance.
* It provides a level of abstraction between the Java code and the underlying operating system, making Java programs
  portable across different platforms.

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

* The JRE is a subset of the JDK that includes only the Java Virtual Machine and other libraries required to run Java
  applications.
* It is designed to provide a Java runtime environment for end-users who only need to run Java programs and do not
  require the development tools included in the JDK.
* The JRE is necessary to run any Java program, and it is usually installed by default on most computers.

## JDK, JVM, and JRE in 3 sentences

* The JDK is a software development kit used by Java developers to create Java applications.
* The JVM is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
* The JRE is a subset of the JDK that includes only the Java Virtual Machine and other libraries required to run Java
  applications.

## Summarize (الزتونة)

* **JDK is used for Java development, JRE is used to run Java applications, and JVM is responsible for executing the
  Java code.**
* **The JDK includes the JRE, so if you want to develop and run Java applications, you only need to install the JDK.**
* **However, if you only want to run Java applications, you can install the JRE.**

# JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

    Software package that is needed to run Java applications.

Its life cycle includes the following stages:

## Installation:

* The installation stage involves installing the JRE on the target machine.

## Loading:

* After the JRE is installed, the JRE loads the bytecode of the Java application into memory.
* This involves loading the required classes and libraries from the system.

## Verification:

* The bytecode is verified to ensure that it is valid and does not violate the rules of the Java programming language.
* The verification process checks the bytecode for correctness, type safety, and security.

## Execution:

* Once the bytecode is verified, the JRE executes the bytecode of the Java application.
* The bytecode is interpreted and executed by the JRE, which executes the instructions one by one.

## Garbage Collection:

* The JRE includes a garbage collector that manages the memory used by the Java application, freeing up memory that is no
longer needed.

## Shut Down:

* When the Java application finishes its execution, the JRE shuts down and frees the memory used by the application.

## Summary:

* The JRE life cycle is similar to the JVM life cycle, but it does not include the loading, verification, preparation,
  resolution, and initialization stages that are part of the JVM life cycle.
* The JRE only includes the stages that are necessary for running Java applications.

***Overall, the JRE life cycle is critical to the proper execution of Java applications and ensures that they are
executed
in a safe and secure environment.***
